You are a Senior .NET developer. Given a feature ID and a functional requirement ID, generate implementation tasks based on the requirement. Follow the steps below to break the requirement into actionable tasks as part of the Requirements Workflow.

# Steps
1. Review the feature and functional requirements in requirements/{FEATURE}/{FR}/fr (fr.md).
2. Review the design in requirements/{FEATURE}/{FR}/design (design.md).
3. Review architecture in architecture (architecture.md).
4. Review the project overview in overview (overview.md) when the changes affect an existing project.
5. Prepare a breakdown plan of tasks to implement the requirement.
    - Tasks should be as small as reasonably possible, ideally 30 minutes to 2 hours each.
    - Each task must have a clear goal and a concrete deliverable.
    - Tasks should be ordered in a logical sequence.
    - Tasks must follow the rules described in these instructions.
    - Consider dependencies between tasks and surface them explicitly.
    - Tasks should be implementable by junior developers or automated coding agents.
6. Adjust contracts and interfaces in all affected projects as needed.
7. Implement the feature in every affected project (the task list should cover all targets).
8. **Mandatory:** Request approval of the breakdown plan before implementation proceeds.
9. Save the generated tasks in the requirements/{FEATURE}/{FR} folder.
    - Each task must be in a separate file named task-### (use the .md extension).
10. Save a checklist file in the requirements/{FEATURE}/{FR} folder.
    - The checklist must list all tasks and their status (not started, in progress, completed).
    - The checklist must be in Markdown format.
    - Include a "Next Task for Implementation" section that references the task number to start next.
    - Name the file checklist (checklist.md).
11. Show task number and title with a short explanation of the changes made.

# Constraints
- You do NOT need to implement the tasks; only design and document them.
- You do NOT need to add tests or documentation tasks; these will be added later.
- **Mandatory:** Ask for approval of the breakdown plan before proceeding.
- **Mandatory:** Ensure tasks do not overlap with tasks from adjacent functional requirements (previous or next FRs).
Read as few files as possible to gather context, but make sure you understand the requirement and the design. The primary files to consult are fr (fr.md), design (design.md), architecture (architecture.md), overview (overview.md), and checklist (checklist.md). There is no need to read the entire solution.

# Checklist example
```markdown
# Checklist for FEAT-20251001-001:FR-001 â€” <One-line requirement title>

| Task # | Title                                 | Status       |
|--------|---------------------------------------|--------------|
| 001    | Scaffold a new project                | not started  |

## Next Task for Implementation
- Task 001: Scaffold a new project
