# Acceptance Criteria (Given / When / Then)
- Given the customer is viewing the shopping cart with items and total price
- When the customer enters a valid coupon code and clicks the Apply button
- Then the coupon discount MUST be applied and the new total MUST be displayed

- When the customer clicks the Apply button
- Then an error message MUST be displayed informing the user the coupon is invalid or expired
- Given a coupon is successfully applied
- When the customer clicks Remove button next to the coupon
- Then the coupon MUST be removed and the total MUST revert to the original price
