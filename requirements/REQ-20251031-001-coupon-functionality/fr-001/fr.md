# REQ-20251031-001:FR-001 â€” Create Coupon API with MongoDB integration

# User Story
As an administrator, I want a dedicated Coupon API with MongoDB storage so that I can programmatically manage coupons for the e-commerce platform.

# Acceptance Criteria (Given / When / Then)
- Given the Coupon API is deployed and integrated with MongoDB
- When the API receives requests to create, retrieve, update, or delete coupons
- Then the operations MUST persist data to MongoDB and MUST return appropriate HTTP responses

# Test Outline
1. Deploy Coupon API and verify MongoDB connection.
2. Execute CRUD operations via API endpoints and verify data persists in MongoDB.
3. Verify error handling for invalid requests and database failures.

# Rationale
A dedicated Coupon API enables centralized coupon management, simplifies the architecture by separating concerns, and provides a scalable foundation for all coupon-related functionality across the platform.
