# User Story
As a customer, I want to see the applied coupon discount on the My Orders page so that I can verify the discount was applied and review my purchase history.

# Acceptance Criteria (Given / When / Then)
- Given a customer has placed an order with a coupon discount applied
- When the customer navigates to the My Orders page
- Then each order MUST display the coupon code and discount amount if applicable
- Given an order without a coupon applied
- When the customer views the My Orders page
- Then the discount section SHOULD show "No coupon applied" or be hidden
- Given a customer is reviewing past orders
- When the order list is displayed
- Then coupon information MUST be accurate and match the order record in the database

# Test Outline
